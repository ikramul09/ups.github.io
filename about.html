    The light of the world, the beacon in the dark 
    and the hope that gives us strength to survive, 
    is our teacher. Today we celebrate Teachers' Day.
     A day, kept aside to honour the gifted souls who work 
     everyday to make sure that the future is bright for all of us.
      Let us welcome all the teachers with a big round of applause.
    
    
    On this beautiful occasion, let us take the opportunity to convey 
    our wishes to all our teachers, who have given impeccable contribution
     in shaping us.
    
    Every year 5th of September, we celebrate Teachers Day. It is a day
     filled with lots of excitement, joy and happiness as students are
      eagerly looking forward to tell their teachers how and why are
       they special to them. It is my honour to to talk about our dear 
       teachers on this wonderful occasion.
    
    We celebrate Teachers' day on 5th of September every year in India. 
    September 5th is marked by the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli 
    Radhakrishnan and the Teachers' day is celebrated in commemoration 
    of his birthday. Along with being a succesful leader in the form of
     the President of the Country, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was great

        Republic Day Speech
        Dear principal, teachers and friends
        As we all know we have gathered here for the Republic Day celebration. I am excited and glad to get a chance to say something about our country.
        This year, we are celebrating 71st republic day of our country. We celebrate republic day on January 26th, the day when the constitution of India came into effect.
        I am proud to be a citizen of India which ensures the fundamental rights of every citizen such as right to equality, freedom, religion, culture, education, privacy etc.
        On this auspicious occasion, let’s bow our heads before the memories of India’s freedom fighters and great leaders. I would like to wind up my speech followed by a moment of silence for those great souls.
        This is an occasion to reaffirm our commitment to unity in diversity, fraternity and equality among all our citizens.
        Thanks again for giving me an opportunity to speak in front of you all.
        Jai Hind</p></div>
